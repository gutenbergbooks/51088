<p class="drop-capi">IN 1824, when General Lafayette arrived at Philadelphia, and
was nobly welcomed as “The Nation’s Guest,” the writer
of this book was staying several weeks at the hospitable
home of his amiable and kind relative, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Betsy Ross</span>. The arrival
of Lafayette excited and brightened her extraordinary memory, as
she very cheerfully entertained all her friends, by relating the most
interesting facts of the Revolution, and its <span class="smcap">Flag</span> of Victory. Her
words we well remember. She objected, as a member of the society
of “Friends,” to sit for her portrait, nevertheless, a miniature of her
in crayon was made, and is now highly prized; and at this late day,
we deem it our duty to publish the true history of the origin of the
first <span class="smcap">Flag</span> of our Country, and the patriotism of America’s most illustrious
Heroine.</p>

<p>Listen to her thrilling, cheering voice, her soul-inspiring, martial
song, whilst a dozen of the ladies of her household joined in the chorus,
as she handed over each Flag to the gallant troops, on their way to
camp, and roused their enthusiasm to the highest pitch. The ladies
of the Revolution loved her for her magnanimous and modest Quaker
deportment, and the army of Washington applauded her dignified
admonitions, so full of patriotism and power of song. Quakers very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>

a spirit power, only to be equalled by absolute phrensy, she
waved her Flag aloft, and she did sing to the gallant volunteers, the</p>

<p>Many inspired songs (after the close of the war for American Independence)
were carried home by Gen. Lafayette, (the companion of
Washington,) Rochambeau, and many of the French engineers and
soldiers, on their return to France, having proved their chivalry and
united their hearts, blood, songs and arms with Americans, for the
liberties of America; and, but for the “<span class="smcap">War Song</span>” of <span class="smcap">Betsy Ross</span>,
the “Marseillaise Hymn” would not have been written by Rouget de
Lille, a French officer of engineers, in 1791. Marshal Luckner commanded
the French Revolutionary army at that time on their march
from Marseilles to Paris; that whole army became phrensied by the
words of the “<span class="smcap">War Songs</span>” of American Independence, that they
had helped to gain, and Rouget de Lille caught the inspiratory words,
“<i>And hark, away to arms! to conquest we will go!</i>” and quickly composed
the song that he entitled the “<i>Chant de Guerre de l’ Armée du
Rhin</i>,” the “War Song of the Army of the Rhine,” which the Parisians,
some years afterwards, named the “<i>Hymne des Marseillaise</i>.” Thus
the “<i>War Song of Independence</i>” became combined, in word and spirit,
in the “<i>Marseillaise Hymn</i>,” and has ever since enlivened the march
of the armies of France to conquest and played an important part in
the revolutions, not only of France, but of other Continental States.</p>

<p>In 1870, William J. Canby, Esq., (the grandson of Mrs. John
Ross,) of Philadelphia, read before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania,
a very interesting paper on the subject of the “Centennial
Anniversary of the American Flag,” in which he stated that his maternal
grandmother, “Betsy Ross,” was the first maker of the “Stars
and Stripes.” She lived in Arch street at the time, and continued in
the business of making Flags for many years.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">MISS ELIZABETH GRISCOM was born 1742, in Philadelphia,
and was married in 1762 to Mr. John Ross, a merchant
of that city. She was a strict member of The Society
of Friends, and by them always called “<span class="smcap">Betsy Ross</span>.” She was unsurpassed
in fine needlework, and well known throughout Philadelphia
and New York cities as the most artistic upholstress in America.
She used the most superior, richest and finest of imported embroidered
velvets, satins, silks and woolens, that were brought to this country
by the packet ships of Caleb and Thomas Cope, Boyd &amp; Reed, and
John Ross, agreeably to her express orders; and she had a dozen or
more of her sisters, daughters and nieces constantly employed sewing
and finishing variegated needlework, in the very best manner, as she
directed them; and thus no other upholsterer could possibly compete
with her. She was a natural artist, an inventive genius, who fully
understood the best effects of complimentary colors, and the grandeur
of the primary colors; yet, strange as it may appear, though one of
the plainest of “<span class="smcap">Quakers</span>,” she invariably used cloths of the very
<i>brightest</i>, and in every instance the <i>primary colors combined, so as to be
distinguished from all other objects</i>, and she quickly judged and comprehended
the styles that would best please her customers. Her brilliant
draperies and tri-colored curtains, in the public halls, hotel parlors,
and drawing rooms, were greatly admired; whilst General
Washington, General Hand, Thomas Mifflin, George Clymer, Jared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Ingersoll, J. Koch, Gouveneur Morris, Robert Morris, Judge James
Wilson, Frederick A. Muhlenberg, Joseph Wilson, Caleb and Thomas
Cope, Thomas Wilson, Timothy Matlack, James Trimble, and William
Shippen, are some of the names on her store-books, as her generous
and kind friends and patrons, whose heirs still possess beautiful
curtains and magnificent quilts of variegated silks and satins, unsurpassed,
at this day, for beauty of utility, justness of composition, that
none but a perfect artist could produce; and the constant use of materials
of primary colors were her praise, excellence, and fame.</p>

<p>Colonel George Ross, (a member of the Continental Congress,) and
James Trimble, (afterwards Deputy Secretary of Pennsylvania,)
were her brothers-in-law, and through their suggestions, she adorned,
with drapery, the Hall of Congress, and the Governor’s reception room.
Her upholstery in the ladies’ cabins and state rooms of Caleb and
Thomas Cope’s packet ships was unrivalled and not equalled by the
state rooms of the European packets; whilst from the topmasts of
Cope’s packets, her waving red, white, and blue <small>STREAMERS</small> made glad
the travelers of the seas, several years before the Revolution of 1776.
Some of the theatres and public halls of Philadelphia were embellished
and decorated with curtains of white, mazarine, and scarlet velvets and
silks in waves, festoons, and pendents, and in many instances the curtains
were embroidered with gold and silver figures of vines, leaves,
and <i>stars</i> that glittered with superb brilliancy, whilst the curtains were
invariably supported by a golden spread eagle, with lightning darts
in its talons and a silvery olive branch in its beak; and these were
the original and wonderful <i>handiwork</i> of Betsy Ross. She could not
think of or invent anything <i>brighter or more graceful</i> than her most
celebrated gay and glittering primary colored <i>curtains</i>, spangled with
stars and supported by a golden eagle, that already ornamented and
adorned the interior of the chief <span class="smcap">Halls</span> of the land. They were her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
daily delight and divinely brilliant dreams by night. With her <i>scissors</i>
she cut the form of a small shield, upon which she sewed five-pointed
stars and tri-colored stripes, in imitation of General Washington’s
coat-of-arms, which embraced stars and pales upon his escutcheon;
this shield she fastened upon the eagle’s breast; and, inspired
with one bright thought, she seized her meritorious daily work, flung
it to the breeze, hung it “<small>UPON THE OUTER WALLS</small>,” and the Freemen
of Columbia cheered, and hailed it “<span class="smcap">The Flag of the Union</span>!”
And that one independent <small>FLING</small> made all the people <span class="smcap">King</span>!</p>

<p>At the request of Dr. Franklin, Mr. Robert Morris and Col. George
Ross, she designed and made the first <span class="smcap">Flag</span> of the United States,
consisting of thirteen red and white stripes, a blue field as a square,
on the left and upper corner, and upon the blue field was a spread
eagle, with thirteen stars, in a circle of rays of glory, surrounding its
head, and the United States <span class="smcap">Seal</span> was afterwards made from the same
design of the United States Flag, viz: A red, white and blue shield
on the breast of an American Eagle, holding in its talons an olive
branch and thirteen arrows; in its beak a scroll inscribed with this
motto, “<i>E Pluribus Unum</i>,” and above its head thirteen stars arranged
in a circle of glory. These designs were approved and adopted by
the Committee and Congress, and they were made before the words
“United States of America,” were legally used. The country was
called “Columbia,” the Congress was styled the “Continental Congress,”
the States were called “Colonies,”; every petition sent to the
King of Great Britain, and every public document, were issued by
“The North American Colonies;” our Country <i>had no name</i> until
<span class="smcap">Betsy Ross</span> marked upon her Flags, “<span class="smcap">The United States of
America</span>.” Dr. Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson had
been appointed (December, 1775, by Congress, a Secret Committee)
to prepare a <span class="smcap">Flag</span>, and a device for a <span class="smcap">Seal</span> for the Colonies, and Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Rittenhouse was requested by the Committee, to engrave the Seal
corresponding with the eagle on the Flag.</p>

<p>On the 4th day of July, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was
finished and signed, and the Rev. Dr. Duché, Chaplain of Congress,
had offered up his celebrated “<i>Prayer of Independence</i>,” the <span class="smcap">Star
Spangled Banner</span> was unfurled, and emblazoned the Hall of Independence,
and hung around the spire of the Old State House Bell, as it
sounded its tones of warning beyond the city limits, re-echoed across
the Delaware, and proclaimed the liberty of the land, amidst the thundering
shouts of Freemen, the roaring of cannons, musketry, firearms,
and bonfires; then the Secret Committee, Franklin, Jefferson
and Adams, was publicly announced by the President of Congress,
and the <span class="smcap">Seal</span> (already made) of the “<i>United Colonies</i>,” was used that
day. Aye! the Flags waved, the Seal was engraved, and the thirteen
“<span class="smcap">United States of America</span>” were saved.</p>

<p>The Flag was afterwards adopted by Congress, June 14, 1777, and
September 15, 1789, they passed the act, that “The <span class="smcap">Seal</span> heretofore
used by the ‘<span class="smcap">United Colonies</span>’ in Congress assembled, shall be the
<span class="smcap">Seal</span> of the ‘<span class="smcap">United States</span>;’” and for his beautiful workmanship in
engraving that seal, Dr. Rittenhouse was honored with the appointment
of Director of the United States Mint; and Franklin styled Rittenhouse,
“the Newton of America.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ross also engaged Mr. George Barrett, (of Cherry near Third
street, Philadelphia,) an ornamental painter, and accomplished artist,
to paint upon the blue fields of one dozen silk Flags, a gilded bald-headed
spread eagle, with thirteen silvered stars encircling its head
in rays of glory, which were executed in the finest artistic style, for
the use of Congress and General Washington’s army; they were always
much admired, and daily used until worn out; and, Betsy Ross
also directed Mr. Barrett to ornament the army drums with the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
design of the eagle and thirteen stars, and the letters “United States
of America,” that gave great delight and spirit to the drummers, to
such an extent that Mr. Barrett was kept busy ornamenting flags,
flagstaffs, and drums for Washington’s army. The committee of
Congress were so much pleased with the design of the eagle and thirteen
stars that they concluded to adopt and use it for the “<span class="smcap">National
Seal</span>” exclusively; but, Betsy Ross, Col. George Ross, and Lieut.
Paul Jones earnestly protested against despoiling the Flag by leaving
out and omitting the eagle, and declared that the Army might, if they
choose, have the stars only, but as for the Navy they would never give
up the <span class="smcap">Bald Eagle</span>, the conquerer of all birds, belonging only to
America; and from that day to this the bald eagle of America spreads
its wings upon the Flags of the United States Revenue vessels as the
emblem of freedom, independence, liberty, power, empire, and victory.</p>

<p>From that time our beautiful Flag was composed of thirteen stars
and stripes. The red stripes were emblematic of fervency and zeal;
the white, of integrity and purity; the blue field with stars, of unity,
power, and glory. The number thirteen was symbolical of the thirteen
colonial states, that severed their allegiance from the sovereignty
of Great Britain, and declared, in 1776, that they were free and independent
powers.</p>

<p>The size of the Flag of the army is six feet six inches in length, by
four feet four inches in width, with seven red and six white stripes.
The first seven stripes, (four red and three white,) bound the square
of the blue field for the stars, the stripes extending from the extremity
of the field to the end of the Flag. The eighth stripe is white, extending
partly at the base of the field.</p>

<p>According to the act of Congress, April 4, 1818, on the admission
of every new State into the Union, a star was to be added to the galaxy
of the most brilliant Banner of earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Betsy Ross put all her household to work in earnest, and the
“<span class="smcap">Flags</span>,” made of silk and bunting, were not only admired, but afterwards
approved and adopted by the committee of Congress. General
George Washington, Dr. Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson,
frequently visited her store, to see what progress she was making, and
were not only pleased, but expressed their astonishment at her dexterity
and judgment, and in the most flattering terms complimented
her for her remarkable skill with the <small>SCISSORS</small>, as she folded a piece
of white silk and with one cut formed the beautiful five-pointed star.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ross, by order of the Government, continued making the army
and navy Flags of the United States for upwards of fifty-five years,
and after her death, in 1832, her daughter, Mrs. Clarissa S. Wilson
continued the business, and they became generally and widely known
as the most patriotic ladies of America. After the death of Mr. John
Ross, she was married to Mr. John Claypoole, the grandson of Sir
John Claypoole, the grandson of Oliver Cromwell, who came to Philadelphia
with William Penn. She afterwards moved from Arch near
Third street, to Second street near Dock, where she resided until her
death, at the good old age of four score years and ten.</p>

<p>Mrs. Betsy Ross was of medium height, strong in form, but remarkably
graceful and erect; she had a handsome face, a very fair transparent
complexion, projecting eyebrows, blue sparkling eyes, and light
brown hair. She was a perfect “<span class="smcap">Friend</span>” in all her speech and movements;
possessed of the most refined sprightly intellect and polished
education; in fact she was well known throughout the whole of Philadelphia
city, as a “<i>sharp, thorough going woman</i>.” <span class="smcap">First</span> in Friends’
Meeting, where the spirit moved her to speak and to act; <span class="smcap">First</span> amidst
the Daughters of Benevolence, furnishing clothing and lint for the
Continental troops, scattering printed patriotic songs and appeals
amongst them; and <span class="smcap">First</span> and most effective in her attentions to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
sick. She was, in truth, what her friends styled her, “A Healing
Medium,”—but respected and esteemed by all the physicians and surgeons
of Philadelphia, as “<i>the true Friend of the sick</i>,” for when her
hand touched and bathed the burning fevered brow of the sick soldier,
he knew that he had one friend, and that friend was a true one. Whenever
she entered the sick chamber, she saturated her handkerchief with
vinegar, (that she carried in a phial in her pocket, as a precaution
against contagion,) and after wiping her forehead, lips and hands, she
quietly approached the bedside of the afflicted invalid, and placing her
hand upon his forehead, she would whisper these words, “<i>In the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray that your health may be restored</i>,” and
then she would administer the medicines and restoratives as directed
by the visiting physicians; and her angelic nature, purer than that of
Jeanne Dare, was the powerful agency of health. She was the worthiest
Heroine of the Revolution.</p>

<p>During the frightful devastation caused by the yellow fever in 1793,
Mrs. Betsy Ross was most active in alleviating the terrible miseries of
that epidemic. Moved with sorrow at the sufferings of others, she carried
not only her own life in her hands, but medicines to relieve the
sick and dying. Day and night she ceased not; whilst her angelic
visits were cheered with success. Her personal perfections irresistably
commanded the admiration and love of the sick and afflicted to such a
degree, that the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Rush, styled her the “Magical
Quakeress.” They who would not now honor, esteem, and love
the name of Betsy Ross do not deserve to enjoy the protection of the
glorious starry Flag of the Union, in the land of the free and home of
the brave, or in any land upon earth where the Flag of the Union
waves. Her biography will ornament the brightest pages of our country’s
history, and her <small>STATUE</small>, surrounded by a group of her daughters
and nieces, cutting, sewing and making the “Star Spangled Banners,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
must soon grace the Capitol of our nation, and the patriotic Ladies of
America will design, erect, and pay for it. Yes, the friend of Washington,
Franklin, Adams, Jefferson, Morris, Jones, Rittenhouse, Ross,
the immutable friend of Liberty, and of the soldiers of the Independence
of 1776, will forever live in the hearts of all freemen.</p>

<h2>JOHN PAUL JONES,<br />

<small>WITH THE FIRST U. S. FLAG, ESTABLISHING THE FREEDOM OF THE SEAS.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-p.jpg" width="57" height="57" alt="P" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">PAUL JONES, the bravest of Naval Commanders, was born
at Selkirk, Scotland, 1730, and came to America about 1770,
to fight the battles of Liberty and Independence. He was
styled “The Washington of the Seas,” “The deadliest foe of Cowards.”
Lieutenant Paul Jones and Mrs. Elizabeth Ross, of Philadelphia,
became intimate friends and neighbors, well known as the most
zealous patriots in the cause of Independence, doing battle against
tyrants and oppressors, and Thomas Jefferson, Dr. Franklin, John
Adams, Dr. Rittenhouse and Robert Morris were their truest and
most steadfast friends and patrons. Mrs. Ross designed and made
the Flag that Lieutenant Jones hoisted upon the Flagship of War,
in the Delaware bay. During the month of December, 1775, by the
request and explicit orders of Dr. Franklin, Col. George Ross and
Robert Morris, the three members of a Secret Committee of Congress,
Lieutenant Jones was supplied with one of Mrs. Ross’ first and best
Flags, the red white and blue emblem of Liberty, for which Congress
paid. Afterward, for Jones’ brave honoring of that Flag, Congress
awarded him $25,000 and a golden medal, and he was further complimented
by an invitation to Paris, where the cross of military merit
and a sword of honor were presented to him by the King of France,
at the written request of our Congress, for his dauntless courage and
his triumphant victory as the Captain of the “<span class="smcap">Richard</span>,” with the
first Flag of the Union, over the British Flag of the “<span class="smcap">Serapis</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>In January 1776, the following vessels were fitted out.</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>,” of thirty guns and three hundred men, Dudley Saltonstall,
Captain, bearing the Pine Tree Flag, presented by the colony
of Connecticut.</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">Columbus</span>,” of twenty-eight guns and three hundred men,
Abraham Whipple, Captain, bearing the Flag of the Red Cross of
Saint George, presented by the Colony of Vermont.</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">Andrew Doria</span>,” of eighteen guns and two hundred men,
Nicholas Biddle, Captain, bearing the Flag of the White Cross of
Saint Andrew, presented by the Philadelphians.</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">Cabot</span>,” of fourteen guns and two hundred men, John W.
Hopkins, Captain, bearing the Pine Tree white silk Flag from Connecticut.</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">Providence</span>,” of twelve guns, bearing the Flag with the
Cross of Saint Andrew, presented by Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">Hornet</span>,” of fourteen guns, bearing the yellow silk Flag of
Virginia, with Rattlesnake.</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">Wasp</span>,” eight guns, bearing the yellow silk Flag of South
Carolina, with a Crescent, a Beaver and a Rattlesnake, with the motto,
“Don’t tread on me.”</p>

<p>The Dispatch vessel “<span class="smcap">Fly</span>,” bearing a blue Flag with Red Cross
of Saint George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. Hopkins</span>, was Commander-in-chief of the fleet, and <span class="smcap">John Paul
Jones</span> first lieutenant. <span class="smcap">Jones</span> was offered the command of the sloop
“<span class="smcap">Providence</span>,” which he declined, declaring that he preferred to be
“<span class="smcap">Chevalier Bannaret</span>,” to hoist and carry the bald eagle, with
glittering stars and stripes, on the flagship “<span class="smcap">Alfred</span>,” and when the
Commander-in-chief, E. Hopkins, came on board of her, January 1,
1776, Jones hoisted the American Union Flag, with his own hands,
which was the first time it was ever displayed on a man-of-war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
waving his navy cap swiftly overhead, shouted “<span class="smcap">Three Cheers for
the Red, White and Blue! The Haughtiest of Monarchs
shall bow before that Flag!!!</span>” “Again, <span class="smcap">Three cheers for
our Commander-in-Chief and the American Navy!!!</span>” And
thus he boldly evinced his lofty and chivalrous character, bravely
assuming the responsibility, and his achievement of glorious deeds
aided in the recognition of our <span class="smcap">Independence</span>.</p>

<p>On the 14th day of February, 1778, the United States Flag was, for
the first time, recognized in the fullest and completest manner by the
Flag of France. Lieutenant Paul Jones, on board the brig “<span class="smcap">Independence</span>,”
at the entrance of Quiberon bay, sailed through the French
fleet, commanded by Admiral La Motte Piquet, (who was keeping
the coast of France clear of British cruisers,) and our <span class="smcap">National Emblem</span>
was most courteously complimented and saluted by nine guns.
The American Flag was first carried around the world in 1789, by the
“<span class="smcap">Columbia</span>,” Captain Gray, of Boston, <small>AND SALUTED IN EVERY
PORT</small>.</p>

<h2>THE COLONY REBEL FLAGS.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-p.jpg" width="57" height="57" alt="P" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">PRIOR to July 4th, 1776, various kinds of Flags were used.
Mr. Endicott, Puritan Governor, aided in a religious crusade
against the cross of St. George; he cut the cross from
the Flag flying at Salem, and was tried for treason, but escaped on the
ground that his act was not actuated by treasonable motives, but religious
zeal.</p>

<p>About the first of January, 1776, the immortal Washington unfurled
his Flag in compliment to the United Colonies, but it was so
nearly like the British Flag, that the Bunker Hill patriots objected to
it, because it was a blue Flag with the St. George and St. Andrew’s
crosses combined; too much like the Flag of the Britons. Nearly every
regiment had its own colony Flag. All sorts of devices, corresponding
with the variegated coats of the Continental troops, or militia, scarcely
two alike. They were styled “Colony Rebel Flags;” still, the “Colony
Rebel Flags” were all used as rallying Flags, until they were
eclipsed by the starry Flag, called “The Appeal to Heaven,”—“The
Star Spangled Banner.”</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="57" height="57" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">TO General Putnam, desiring him in the most pressing terms,
to give <i>positive orders</i> to all the Colonels to have “Union
Colors” immediately completed for their respective regiments;
and Colonel Kitzema received the two first regimental silk
“stars and stripes” from the secret committee of Congress, through
General Putnam, and Colonel Curtenieus; whilst the brilliant Banner
of the Union floated from the top of Washington’s headquarters in
New York City.</p>

<p>The real truth was, that previous to the “Declaration of Independence,”
the leaders of our armies, the Governors of the thirteen colonies,
and the Continental Congress were afraid to publicly unfurl an
<span class="smcap">Independent Union Flag</span>; even Washington’s combined crosses
were discountenanced, disapproved of, and treated with indifference;
but, the boldness of Colonel George Ross and John Ross, with the
dashing, daring seamanship of <span class="smcap">Paul Jones</span>, the firm patriotism, industry,
and energy of that devoted friend of Independence, the <span class="smcap">Immortal
Betsy Ross</span>, who forced the “Flag of Liberty” forward, as
true patriots of America, bid defiance to all Tory opposition, and
flaunted the Stars and Stripes from the highest pinnacles of our land,
the “<span class="smcap">Union Standard</span>,” that was never styled a “<span class="smcap">Rebel Flag</span>,”
or Flag of any single Colony or State, but was styled “<span class="smcap">The Appeal
to Heaven</span>,” made the cherished Flag of Independence, the triumphant
Flag of Earth!</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="57" height="57" alt="T" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE Flag of Virginia was a rattlesnake with blue tongue
forked like lightning, and with thirteen rattles, looking like
a fierce Anaconda coiled, but with head and tail up, painted
on white silk, having the motto, “Don’t tread on me!” It was considered
as an emblem of wisdom, and of endless duration as a representative
of America, an animal found in no other part of the world.
The eye of this creature excels in brightness that of any other animal;
it has no eyelids and is therefore an emblem of vigilance. It never
begins an attack nor ever surrenders, it is therefore an emblem of
magnanimity and true courage. It never wounds until it has given
notice to its enemies of their danger. Its wounds, however small, are
decisive and fatal. The power of fascination attributed to it resembles
America. Those who look steadily in its eyes are delighted, and
involuntarily advance toward, and having once approached it, never
leave it.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">AT the battle of Yorktown, October 19, 1781, the French
troops triumphantly carried our American Stars and Stripes,
with the spread eagle on the blue field, for the eagle was
their adoration, and they stormed the redoubts, led on by the chivalric
and heroic Generals Muhlenberg and Lafayette, who immediately
hoisted that Flag upon the turret of the fortifications. The instant
that Lord Cornwallis spied it, he was terror stricken. The waving of
that Flag compelled him to surrender; for that Flag was the proclamation
of Victory! and <small>IT</small> ended the war in a blaze of glory.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="57" height="57" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">WHEREVER the Flag of Betsy Ross went, it waved majestically
and above suspicion; no temptation or opposition
could deter it, for her godly prayer went with it, and upon
every Flag she forwarded, she pinned her printed message, viz:
“<span class="smcap">Every man that is against this Flag is a Traitor.</span>” Aye!
where the battle was the hottest, and amidst the hail of fire where
the bullets fell the fastest and thickest, that Flag cheered the wounded
and dying patriots to shout “<span class="smcap">Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!</span>”
And when the brave Commander Lawrence saw that the Flag on his
Frigate still waved, though wounded and dying, he cried out, in these
immortal words, “Don’t give up the ship!”</p>

<p>On the 28th of June, 1776, the British Fleet and Army of Sir
Henry Clinton commenced their furious “Attack on Fort Moultrie,”
but, one circumstance serves to illustrate the daring, enthusiastic
courage and love for the Flag of Independence which pervaded the
American Troops. In the course of the engagement, the Flag staff
of the Fort was shot away, followed by peals of derision from the
minions of the Fleet, but Sergeant <span class="smcap">Jasper</span> leaped down upon the
beach, snatched up the Flag, fastened it to a sponge-staff, and while
the ships were incessantly directing their broadsides upon the Fort,
he mounted the merlon and deliberately replaced the Flag, shouting
“<small>IT STILL FLIES!</small>” That warrior’s shout was echoed by the Garrison,
and suddenly checked Sir Henry’s derision. The British Fleet
and Army were greatly mortified by the <i>flying Stars and Stripes</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
were terribly repulsed by the brave defence of Fort Moultrie, whilst
the whole Garrison were fiercely echoing and re-echoing the shout—“<small>IT
STILL FLIES!!</small>” The news of this undaunted intrepidity and exulting
victory spread throughout the continent, and Sergeant <span class="smcap">Jasper</span>
was honorably promoted by Congress for his unparalleled heroism.
Yes, thank God, our Flag “<small>IT STILL FLIES</small>,” and never can be conquered.</p>

proclaiming by its expanding, snapping, cracking, sharper, louder
sounds, the establishment of Freedom, Liberty, Independence, and
the Union of the World! whilst in every house its graceful folds
protected each and all in their own religious, family worship; the

<h3>STIRRING APPEALS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL
LIBERTY.</h3>


<p>“My lads, you say you are going to fight for <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>! these are
words in everybody’s mouth, but few understand their real meaning.
<span class="smcap">Liberty</span> is not a power to do what we please and have what we
desire; this may be the Liberty of a wolf or of a beast of prey, but is
not the Liberty of a man considered as a member of society. <span class="smcap">True
Liberty</span> is the being governed by laws of our own making; the inhabitants
of every country to choose persons from amongst themselves,
in whom they can confide; which persons so elected shall
make laws to bind the whole. True <span class="smcap">Constitutional Liberty</span> is
the <span class="smcap">Liberty</span> for which we are now contending, and may God in his
blessings grant this to us all.</p>

<p>“Now, the King of England, has sent over fleets and armies to
compel us to give up this invaluable privilege into his hands; but
with the blessings of God, we will maintain it against him and all the
world, so long as we have a man left to fire a musket. Let our constant
prayer be <span class="smcap">God</span> and <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>.</p>

<p>“Our Congress have hitherto conducted us with wisdom and integrity,
and although in some instances it may be thought they might
have managed better than they have done, yet they have piloted us
in safety through a tempestuous ocean, to the present period; and so
God save the <span class="smcap">American Congress</span>!”</p>

<h3>WASHINGTON, THE IDOL OF AMERICA.</h3>


<p>“My lads, I would speak a few words of the <span class="smcap">General</span> and his
<span class="smcap">Army</span>, now encamped on the banks of the Schuylkill, enduring all
the hardships of their homely situation with cheerful patience; and
what is it think you blunts the keen edge of the northern winds, and
makes content smile on the tops of frozen hills? I will tell you, it is
the love of that “<span class="smcap">Liberty</span>” I have sat before you, it is the consciousness
of the justice of our cause. I suppose when you think of
our incomparable <span class="smcap">General Washington</span>, you figure to yourselves
a stout, bulky man, of a terrible countenance, covered with gold lace,
living in a magnificent house and having a great train of attendants
around him. You are quite mistaken; he neither has nor needs any
external ornaments. Would you hang farthing candles around the
Sun to increase his lustre? His glory will admit of no addition.
Your <span class="smcap">General</span> is a plain man, plain in his dress and frugal at his
board; yet a native dignity will command your respect, and the affability
of his manners win your love. He is brave without ostentation;
magnificent without pomp; and accomplished without pride.
He is an honor to the human race and the Idol of America. And so
God save <span class="smcap">General Washington</span> and his <span class="smcap">Army</span>.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">ON the night of September 15, 1814, whilst the British fleet,
under the command of the English Admiral Cochrane, were
bombarding Fort M’Henry, at the city of Baltimore, <span class="smcap">Francis
S. Key</span>, was divinely inspired with the sublime sight of the glorious
Banner of the Union still waving over the Fort, and a thousand
times reflected, multiplying and increasing in splendor, in every stream
of fire throughout the skies, every glare meeting every leaping wave
of the billowy Chesapeake Bay, the heavens and waters together
joined, each wave glaring with new admired light; but, when the Fort
resisted all the efforts of the British ships-of-war, and forced the Admiral
to retire, amidst the joyous exultation, the great shouts of the
countless hosts of freemen, “<i>Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed
gloriously!</i>” “<i>The Flag of the Union still triumphs!</i>” Who? Oh!
Who can imagine the feelings of Francis S. Key, as o’er his head the
flying bombs sang terribly, spent their force in air, and roused all the
internal powers of his poetic spirit, his inspired soul to sing still
louder?</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
